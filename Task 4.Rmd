# Introduction

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE, fig.retina = 3)
```

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Methods

```{r importing data}

file <- "data-raw/sol.txt"
sol <- read_table2(file)
names(sol)

```

```{r tidying data}

# Transpose all the values except the genename

tsol <- sol %>% 
  select(-genename) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  data.frame()

# Use the genenames in sol to name the columns in tsol:

names(tsol) <- sol$genename

# The column names of sol have become the row names of tsol. We can add a column for these as well.

tsol$sample <- row.names(tsol)

# And process the sample name so we have the cell lineage in one column and the replicate in another

tsol <- tsol %>% 
  extract(sample, 
          c("lineage","rep"),
          "(Y[0-9]{3,4})\\_([A-C])")

# Now the data should be in a format to which you can apply the methods.
